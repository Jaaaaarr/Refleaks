Rudimental calculating script for flammable refrigerants

Function is to calculate:

0. Determine if leak is choked or not [True\False]
1. Leak rate of refrigerant [kg/s]
2. Determine degree of dilution [high\medium\low]
3. Estimate zone + distance (ATEX)
4. Calculate relationship between time taken for ventilation below LFL vs ventilation mass flow

For reference IEC 60079-10-1
